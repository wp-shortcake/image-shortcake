Image Shortcake adds a shortcode for images, so that themes can template and
filter images displayed in posts. It is designed to work with the UI provided
by the [Shortcake (Shortcode UI)](https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake)
plugin,

== Description ==

When images are inserted into posts from the media library or media uploader,
only the html of the `<img>` tag and the link around it (if any) are preserved.
This means that themes which want to change the way images are marked up in
content don't have an easy way of doing this.

Image Shortcake is an attempt to solve this problem, by saving images in post
content as _shortcodes_ rather than HTML. The output of shortcodes can be
easily filtered in themes, plugins and templates, and since the original
attachment data is preseved as attributes on the shortcode, it becomes much
easier for modify the way images are marked up in themes.

For best results, use with the [Shortcake (Shortcode
UI)](https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake) plugin. Shortcake offers an
easy to use interface to manage shortcodes in post content.

== Data Migration ==

The plugin comes with two [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org) commands to migrate
images in your existing content into the `[img]` shortcode format used by
this plugin. _Note: if it isn't clear, this is an **early release**. Use
at your own risk, and make sure you've backed up your posts before
migrating!_

`wp image-shortcode migrate <ids> [--dry-run]`

This command searches the post content of the posts specified in `<ids>`,
and replaces any `<img>` tags or `[caption]` shortcodes with `[img]`
shortcodes. Currently it only catches images added through the media
library; custom img tags will not be converted.

If you add the `--dry-run` flag, no replacements will actually be
performed, just a summary report of the changes which would have been
made.

`wp image-shortcode revert <ids> [--dry-run]`

This command finds all `[img]` shortcodes in the content of any of the
posts specified in `<ids>`, and replaces them with the markup that would
be generated by those shortcodes. Note that this runs any filters in your
theme, so that if you have filtered the output of the shortcodes at any
output, those filters will be reflected in the coverted post content.
